1st 3 steps are mandatory for docker container,  4th step is specific for this project. 

Step 1:
Prepare Dockerfile, requirements.txt , docker-compose.yml
Step 2:
Then use command:  docker-compose up 
Step 3:
The container will be running as long as that process the command started is running. 
Once the process is completed and exits then the container will stop and exit. 
So if container exited because of the above reason , we can access it using below command:
docker run -it image_name /bin/bash 

Step 4:

In final.py file we insert Account_23-04-2020.xlsx as input . 

Along with above file , we also insert blank op_account.xlsx.

After executing final.py, we will get 3 different tables in op_account.xlsx.
