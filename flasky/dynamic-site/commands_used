This app is same as text-box-name .   The only difference is, we can change the site dynamacally without re-building the docker image.


How ?

We mapped the folder app as a volume of container. So any change in the app directory will reflect on the site dynamically .


How we mapped? 

We added docker-compose.yml file , in it we mentioned volumes.   

volumes:
      - ./app:/app
