Run playbook by button.

#### 

Install ansible on container :

docker exec -it  my_click_web_1 pip install ansible

####

We added enable.py and disable.py in views.py to execute after clicking button 'Enable Notif' or 'Disable Notif'

#### 

pass_command.py run the playbook delete-paragraph.yml

## 


What do site?

Put Machines in text box.
Press button 'Load machines'.
Load machines will trigger 'external' function defined in views.py.
Input inserted in above text box is taken by 'request.POST.get('param')' and storen in 'inp'
This 'inp' is passed as 1st argument for "replace_string.py" 
replace_string.py replace the 'text_change' string in files "enable_custom_list_machine.yml" and "disable_custom_list_machine.yml"  


Now it is time to put site in text box
After putting "site" if we clicked on button "Disable Notif"
-stop_notif funtion is called 
-which get the site name in "request.POST.get('site')" and store in "inp2"
-This site name is passed as 1st argument for 'disable.py'
-Which later used for the command 'ansible-playbook -l %s disable_custom_list_machine.yml' in place of %s
-disable_custom_list_machine.yml we get it from 'external' function as explained in above paragraph 
-This playbook disable the notifications 
- Then the functions in disable.py "rollback1" and "rollback2" are execute  
- Which bring back the original files "enable_custom_list_machine.yml" and "disable_custom_list_machine.yml" with string "text_change" for further operations 



####home.html

In this file we can see the relations between button name and triggered functions.

Like button "Load machines" and function "external" are defined in one form.

2nd form conain

single input "site" along with 2 functions 'start_notif' and 'stop_notif' 
These functions called when the corresponding buttons 'Enable_notif' and 'disable_notif' are clicked.


#####cat /etc/hosts contains nagios info to as we only pass the machine names through 'all_nagios_group_list'
